# awesome-sliderules
A list of all the awesome resources out there I have found in my quest to build a slide rule

## References
[The International Slide Rule Museum](https://sliderulemuseum.com/) - The de-facto reference source for detailed information, both technical and historical. Very complete image catalog and manual collections


## Professional Guilds 
[The Oughtred Society](https://www.oughtred.org/index.shtml) - One of a few of professional organizations dedicated to mechanical calculation


## Personal Pages
[All About Astro](https://www.allaboutastro.com/sliderules.html) - First personal page I stumbled upon. Very detailed. Also check out his Astrophotography! (the reason I found it - he is Texas based)

## Interactive Slide Rule Simulators / Emulators
Slide rules are not being made any more and existing ones break, so emulators are a nice way to perserve them for people to learn and get a taste for physical ones. This was the beginning of my journey into the rabbit hole 

[Wolf's Collection of Slide Rule Replicas - Part 1](https://www.sliderulemuseum.com/VirtualSR2/index.shtml) and [Part2](https://www.sliderulemuseum.com/VirtualSR.shtml) – This is the emulator replica collection connected with the [ISRM](https://sliderulemuseum.com/) (see above).  The breadth of this collection is amazing.  [Part2](https://www.sliderulemuseum.com/VirtualSR.shtml) is an image oriented catalog + a Curta Model II simulator.

[Astron's Linear Slide Rule](https://friendsofthevigilance.org.uk/Astron/SlideRules/LinearSlideRule/SlideRule.html) - Uber simple, directories are browsable, single JS file, easy to understand source code.

[The Slide Rule Simulator](https://web.archive.org/web/20170124203755/http://www.hercsmusicsystems.com/sliderule.html) – Via the Wayback Machine. Desktop app for Windows and and old version of MacOS. Surprisingly extensable for defining new scales. Written in C++.

[IWA WERN 1638 Slide Rule Simulator](https://www.geogebra.org/classic/y2dbgt95) – Another complex circular slide rule. Simulated in GeoGebra!


## Slide Rule Generators / Instructions for Physical Replicas
These are resources, usually programs to generate resources to make physical, to size, replicas of slide rule scales

[derekp7's Postscript Silde Rule Engine](https://github.com/derekp7/ps-slide-rule-engine) - A single Poscrtipt file to generate a PDF or to print any combination of scales to print out for use on a physical replica. About 6 complete slide rule scale sets in here. Including Ultralog, and circular slide rule! This was actually the first piece of code I looked at when I began my initial search. Postscript is all text and Derek has done a great job of making scale creation and extension pretty easy. Locally you can easily make PDF's with GhostScript and the ```ps2pdf``` command line tool.

[Javier Lopez's Silde-Rule](https://github.com/javierlopez6466/Slide-Rule/tree/master) - Python program to generate scales. Produces PNG's and scaled ones for cutting out stickers on a Silhouette craft cutter.

[Javier Lopez's Instructable Article for Making a Physical Slide Rule](https://www.instructables.com/Slide-Rule-for-the-Modern-Day/) - Uses the previous program to generate the scales.

[Circular Slide Rule Made With a Laser Cutter](https://www.instructables.com/Circular-Slide-Rule-Made-With-a-Laser-Cutter/) - Video and instruction on making a circular slide rule, also from Instructables

[Nuclear Bomb Effects Computer](https://www.fourmilab.ch/bombcalc/) - Reconstruction of a rare circular slide rule distributed in a Department of Energy report by [John Walker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Walker_(programmer)). Detailed instructions [here](https://www.fourmilab.ch/bombcalc/brico.html) and [here](https://www.fourmilab.ch/bombcalc/production.html). [Github repo](https://github.com/Fourmilab/bombcalc_nuclear_bomb_effects_computer) 

[UltraLog 0973](https://www.rechenschieber.org/2006/02/ultralog-0973/) - An attempt to make a modern slide rule manufactured with modern methods

[Dylan's Interactive Haskell Scale Generator](https://github.com/dylan-thinnes/slide-rules-generator) – A nice interactive Haskell based tool to generate scales for replicas. Simple ScaleSpec datastructure with examples to make any scale you can concieve of - even circular ones!
